# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

In this activity, I've built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. I've used Express to handle routing.

[Try it out!](https://frnd7fndr.herokuapp.com/survey) Once you've found the most compatible friend, the modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.

Please feel free to check out [under the hood](https://github.com/MC180G/FriendFinder) for all the magic!
