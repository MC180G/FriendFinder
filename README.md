# FriendFinder

I've built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. A modal will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. I've used Express to handle routing.
