# FriendFinder
Homework Dating App
# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

In this activity, I've built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. I've used Express to handle routing.

* Check out [this demo version of the site](https://friend-finder-fsf.herokuapp.com/). Use this as a model for how we expect your assignment look and operate.

7. Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.
   * The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.

### Reminder: Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Heroku link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

Now that we have a backend to our applications, we use Heroku for hosting. Please note that while **Heroku is free**, it will request credit card information if you have more than 5 applications at a time or are adding a database.

Please see [Herokuâ€™s Account Verification Information](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification) for more details.
